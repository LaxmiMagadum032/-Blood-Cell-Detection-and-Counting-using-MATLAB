# -Blood-Cell-Detection-and-Counting-using-MATLAB

This project focuses on the detection and counting of **Red Blood Cells (RBCs)**,  
**White Blood Cells (WBCs)**, and **Platelets** using **Digital Image Processing techniques**.

The methodology is inspired by the IEEE paper  
**"Implementation of Blood Cell Counting Algorithm using Digital Image Processing Techniques"**.

## 📌 Objectives
- Detect RBCs, WBCs, and Platelets from microscopic blood images
- Accurately count each type of blood cell
- Reduce manual effort in hematological analysis
- Achieve reliable results using image preprocessing and segmentation

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- MATLAB / Python
- Image Processing Toolbox / OpenCV
- Circular Hough Transform
- Morphological Operations
- Thresholding & Segmentation

---

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Image acquisition
2. Preprocessing (grayscale conversion, noise removal)
3. Segmentation of blood cells
4. Feature extraction
5. Classification of RBC, WBC, and Platelets
6. Cell counting and result visualization

---

## 📊 Results
The system successfully detects and counts blood cells from input images,  
with clear differentiation between RBCs, WBCs, and platelets.
